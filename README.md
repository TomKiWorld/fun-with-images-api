# ðŸ¥³ Fun with images API ðŸ¥³

## Preview
https://fierce-oasis-21316.herokuapp.com

## Usage
- Server configuration to manage the database for my [Fun with images](https://github.com/TomKiWorld/fun-with-images) project.
- This App connects to the [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) API to detect colors and faces in images.
- Uses JWT Tokens and Redis to manage sessions and Authorization to access database. 

## Important notes

Before you start, make sure to set up your local data by copying the `.env-example` and setting your credentials.

In **server.js** make sure to set `const productionEnv = '';` to to local or docker to connect to the correct local database during development, and deploy to master with an empty value in order to connect to Heroku (or any other) server.

Once connection with heroku is done, make to sure to run the command `git push heroku master` after each commit to Git (You may replace master with a branch name `git push heroku branchName:master`).

## Local setup with Docker compose

To set up locally with Docker simply run `docker-compose up --build` and Docker will set up local env with a server and database with two users to test with.

To make sure everything runs as expected, it is advised to run `docker-compose down` first to avoid issues during setup.

## Using setup in your own environment
### Server setup
Run `npm install` to download all packages.

`npm start` To run the app.

`npm run-script dev` To run the app in development mode with nodemon, the server will listen to changes and restart every time changes are save.

### Local database setup
Since we use postgreSQL:

1. `brew install postgresql` to install postgreSQL via brew.
2. `brew services start postgresql` to start the service.
3. `createdb 'fun-with-images'` to create the database.
4. `psql 'fun-with-images'` to start creating tables.
5. Users table: 

`CREATE TABLE users (id serial PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, entries bigint DEFAULT 0, avatar VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'avatarOne',joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );`

6. Login table: 

`CREATE TABLE login (id serial PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL, hash VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL);`

7. Images table:

`CREATE TABLE images (id serial PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL, url TEXT NOT NULL, userid int NOT NULL);`

8. Other commands: 

`\d` to see all table; `\q` to quit the service;

`brew services start postgresql` to start the serviceand then `brew services stop postgresql` to stop the service.

**Most importent**: Once you have established a databse connection, create the visitor account which is mendetory for the 'Log in as visitor' Button on the login page!

Name: 'Visitor'

Email: 'visitor@gmail.com'

Password: 'visit'

## Heroku database setup

Once you are dne setting up your app in heroku and added the add-on for postgreSQL run `heroku addons` to make sure the add-on is available

`heroku pg:info` to see connection info.

`heroku pg:psql` to enter edit mode, from here follow steps 5 to 7 from local setup.

Other commands:

`heroku logs --tail` to connect to Heroku server and see logs.

**Don't forget to add the Visitor profile!!**
